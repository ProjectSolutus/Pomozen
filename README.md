**Pomozen** is a modern, open-source Pomodoro timer app designed to boost productivity and focus.  
It applies the Pomodoro Technique—structuring work into focused intervals (typically 25 minutes)  
followed by short breaks. This systematic approach helps combat mental fatigue, maintain  
concentration, and improve efficiency in work or study.
